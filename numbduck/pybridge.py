def extract_connection_ptr(conn):
    """Return the raw C API ``Connection*`` borrowed from a Python duckdb connection.

    Reads the pointer out of *conn*'s pybind11 instance layout using the
    ``PYBIND11_HELD_OBJECT_OFFSET`` / ``DUCKDBPY_CONNECTION_OFFSET`` constants
    (which document the offset derivations). Those offsets are an implementation
    detail of the duckdb Python package, validated on duckdb 1.3.2 / Linux x86-64
    / libstdc++; re-verify them when upgrading duckdb, since stale offsets yield a
    wild pointer whose dereference inside ``duckdb_query`` is undefined behavior
    the ``SELECT 1`` check below cannot catch.

    The pointer is handed out only after four guards: exact-type identity (not
    ``isinstance``, as a subclass or an object spoofing ``__class__`` would steer
    the raw pointer walk through arbitrary memory); runtime coordination (refuse
    when numbduck's JIT libduckdb and the wheel that minted *conn* are different
    builds, i.e. the macOS dual-runtime seam); a null check on each intermediate
    pointer (a closed connection nulls its ``unique_ptr<Connection>``); and a
    best-effort ``SELECT 1`` liveness smoke-test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    conn : duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The ``Connection*`` as a Python int (``intp``-compatible). The pointer is
        **borrowed** from *conn*: it is owned by the ``DuckDBPyConnection`` (which
        holds the ``unique_ptr<Connection>``) and stays valid only while *conn* is
        alive and open. A Python ``int`` cannot keep *conn* referenced, so the
        keep-alive is the caller's responsibility.

    Warning
    -------
    The caller must retain *conn*, alive and open, for the entire lifetime of any
    ``@njit`` use of the returned pointer. Using the pointer after
    ``conn.close()`` or after *conn* is garbage-collected dereferences a dangling
    ``Connection*``: a use-after-free.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If *conn* is not exactly a ``duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection``.
    RuntimeError
        If numbduck's JIT bindings and the Python ``duckdb`` module resolve
        different libduckdb versions, if the extracted pointer is null (a closed
        or uninitialized connection), or if the pointer fails the ``SELECT 1``
        liveness smoke-test.
