# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

numbduck — adapts DuckDB's C API for use inside numba `@njit` code. Built on the [numbox](https://github.com/Goykhman/numbox) bindings toolkit.

## Build & Dev

- Venv: `python3.10 -m venv venv && venv/bin/pip install -e . flake8 pytest`
- Install: `pip install -e .`
- Test: `pytest`
- Lint: `flake8`
- Python: >=3.10
- Key dependencies: `duckdb>=1.3.2,<1.6`, `numbox~=0.5.6`

## Architecture

### Bindings (ducklib.py)

Wraps DuckDB C API functions for use in numba JIT code. Same pattern as numbox bindings:

1. **`utils.py`** — finds and loads the DuckDB shared library via `ctypes.CDLL` with `RTLD_GLOBAL`
2. **`ducklib.py`** — registers signatures in numbox's `signatures` dict, then wraps each function with `@cres` + `_call_lib_func`
3. **`duckdb_utils.py`** — allocates numpy buffers for DuckDB C structs (database, connection, result, chunk, vector)

### Adding a New Binding

1. **Check `duckdb.h` first.** Look up the function signature in [`src/include/duckdb.h`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/v1.3.2/src/include/duckdb.h). Trace every typedef to its underlying type (e.g. `idx_t` → `uint64_t` → `uint64`, `duckdb_prepared_statement` is a pointer → use `_p` suffix). Verify all docstring links point to the correct line in `duckdb.h` at implementation time.
2. Add signature to `ducklib.py`: `signatures["duckdb_func"] = return_type(arg_types...)`
3. Add wrapper following this pattern:
```python
@cres(signatures.get("duckdb_func"))
def duckdb_func(arg):
    return _call_lib_func("duckdb_func", (arg,))
```
4. Function names must match the DuckDB C API names exactly
5. Docstring links must use `https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/c/api.html#func_name`, not links to `duckdb.h` source
6. If a function returns a handle (e.g. `duckdb_logical_type`), also bind the corresponding destroy function (e.g. `duckdb_destroy_logical_type`)
7. **Before submitting an upstream PR**, re-verify all signatures, parameter types, naming conventions (`_p`/`_pp`), and docstring links against `duckdb.h` — this is a second check; step 1 is the first

### Struct-by-value helpers (ducklib.py)

For C functions that pass or return structs by value, `ducklib.py` provides:

- **`_call_lib_func_struct_in`** — ≤16-byte struct passed by value (SysV x86-64) or by pointer (Windows)
- **`_call_lib_func_struct_out`** — ≤16-byte struct returned by value (SysV x86-64) or via sret (Windows)
- **`_call_lib_func_byval`** — arg passed by pointer regardless of platform (e.g. `duckdb_result *`)
- **`_emit_byval_call`** — shared codegen helper for alloca+store+call-via-pointer
- **`_build_packed_interval`** — packs `{i32, i32, i64}` interval into `{i64, i64}` (LLVM drops the second i32 on SysV x86-64)

Custom `@intrinsic` functions are used for >16-byte structs (decimal 24B, varint 24B) and interval (16B but needs repacking). These use `byval` + `optnone` on SysV x86-64 to prevent LLVM from optimizing away stack copies. See [llvmlite#300 comment](https://github.com/numba/llvmlite/issues/300#issuecomment-327235846) for the ABI rationale.

## Key Paths

- `numbduck/ducklib.py` — all DuckDB C API bindings
- `numbduck/duckdb_utils.py` — buffer allocators for DuckDB structs
- `numbduck/utils.py` — shared library loader
- `test/test_ducklib.py` — integration tests

## Error Handling

Bindings must mirror the DuckDB C API error-handling protocol exactly — return state codes (`DuckDBSuccess`/`DuckDBError`) and pointers, never inject exceptions. Callers do C-style return code checks. See [numbox issue #5](https://github.com/Goykhman/numbox/issues/5) for rationale.

## Preferences

- Never include "Co-Authored-By" in git commit messages
- Avoid shell variable substitution in bash — inline actual values directly into commands
- Prefer simpler approaches
- Always git pull before making edits
- Commit messages must not mention AI, Claude, Anthropic, or any AI tooling — only attribute to the user
- Keep all memories in both MEMORY.md and the project CLAUDE.md (CLAUDE.md is in git and survives OS reinstalls)
- Environment details go in MEMORY.md only (may change between OS installs)
- Always exclude CLAUDE.md, .github/workflows/numbduck_ci.yml, and docs/plans/ from upstream PRs (use a dedicated branch based on upstream/main)
- Always use a feature branch — never commit directly to main
- Never merge to main locally — only merge via PR on GitHub after all Actions pass
- Never merge local feature branches into main — main must always match upstream/main (exception: CLAUDE.md)
- Feature branches: base off origin/main (has CLAUDE.md); upstream PR branches: base off upstream/main (no CLAUDE.md)
- Do all coding work on the feature branch (has CLAUDE.md + fork CI), then cherry-pick to the upstream PR branch when ready
- Always enable GitHub Actions on forked repos
- Never assume a reviewer's comment is wrong — always verify claims against actual runtime before responding
- Before posting PR comments, check for pending reviews with existing comments (`GET /pulls/{pr}/reviews/{id}/comments`) — never silently delete a pending review, as it destroys all bundled draft comments
- Preface all AI-authored GitHub comments with "From the fake Slim Shady:"
- Never guess about things that can be verified — check the source of truth before making claims
- Always clean `__pycache__` and numba cache (`~/.cache/numba`) before every pytest run — stale JIT artifacts cause false failures
- Never put implementation planning details (task numbers, phase references, internal tracking) into code comments — comments must be context-independent
- When checking PR comments, show all comments — only skip nelson2005 comments containing "fake Slim Shady" (AI-authored); any other nelson2005 comment is from the user
- When told to "address" review feedback, implement your own recommendations — push back on items you assessed as not worth doing
- Always show PR review comments verbatim — never summarize or paraphrase
- Always include links to specific changed lines when responding to PR review comments
- Use Glob instead of `find` for file searches. Bash `find` is only for operations with side effects (e.g., `-exec rm`)

## Related Projects

- **[numbox](https://github.com/Goykhman/numbox)** — bindings toolkit that numbduck is built on. Provides `signatures` dict, `_call_lib_func`, `@cres` decorator, and shared library loading patterns. Read numbox source before implementing new binding patterns.
- **[numbarrow](https://github.com/Goykhman/numbarrow)** — bridges PyArrow arrays into numba `@njit` code (Arrow → numpy direction). Read numbarrow source before designing any Arrow-based features in numbduck (e.g., virtual tables). numbduck's Arrow work would be the inverse direction (numpy → Arrow/DuckDB).

## Project Status

- **DuckDB Python issue**: duckdb/duckdb-python#404 — requesting C API symbols be exported from the Python wheel. Filed 2026-03-26, awaiting response.
- **macOS C API stripping is intentional**: [duckdb-python PR #81](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-python/pull/81) deliberately exports only `PyInit__duckdb` + `duckdb_adbc_init` via [CMakeLists.txt L83-L110](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-python/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L83-L110). macOS `-exported_symbol` enforces it; Linux `--export-dynamic-symbol` is additive so C API survives by accident.
- **Container value tests**: list/map/struct/array coverage added — all pass on Python 3.12, duckdb 1.5.1, numba 0.64; original segfault not reproduced on this stack

**Key patterns for @cfunc + @njit UDF callbacks:**
1. `@cfunc` cannot use `import` inside body → use module-level `@njit` impl + thin `@cfunc` wrapper
2. `@cfunc` signatures must use `nb_types.intp` (not `nb_types.voidptr`) because numbduck uses `intp` for all pointers
3. `carray()` inside `@njit` requires `voidptr`, but numbduck returns `intp` → use numbox's `_cast_int_to_void_p` intrinsic to bridge the two
4. Result reading in Python test bodies: use `(ctypes.c_int32 * N).from_address(data_p)` (not `carray` which only works in JIT)
5. `duckdb_fetch_chunk(tuple(result))` for result fetching (not `duckdb_result_get_chunk` which doesn't exist in numbduck)
6. Destroy handles via buffer: `buf = numpy.array([handle_p], dtype=numpy.intp); destroy_func(buf.ctypes.data)`
7. Each function in a scalar function set must have its name set via `duckdb_scalar_function_set_name` — the name on the set alone is not sufficient
